= auto-session-timeout

Provides automatic session timeout in a Rails application.

== Installation

Install the gem directly:

  sudo gem install pelargir-auto-session-timeout --source=http://gems.github.com
  
Or install the gem in your Rails project:
  
  script/plugin install git://github.com/pelargir/auto-session-timeout.git

Or clone the project:

  git clone git://github.com/pelargir/auto-session-timeout.git

== Usage

After installing, tell your application controller to use auto timeout:

  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    auto_session_timeout 1.hour
    ...
  end

You will also need to insert this line inside the <body></body> tags in
your views. The easiest way to do this is to insert it once inside your
default or application-wide layout:

  <html>
    <head>...</head>
    <body>
      <%= auto_session_timeout_js %>
      ...
    </body>
  </html>

You need to setup two actions: one to return the session status and
another that runs when the session times out. Define both actions in a
controller (the best choice is probably your user or session controller).
The actions should look like this:

  class SessionsController < ApplicationController
    def active
     render_session_status
    end
    
    def timeout
      render_session_timeout
    end
    ...
  end

You can customize the actions as you see fit, even going so far as to
remove the render calls if you want something different to occur.

Make sure to properly map the actions in your routes.rb file:

  map.active '/active', :controller => 'sessions', :action => 'active'
  map.active '/timeout', :controller => 'sessions', :action => 'timeout'

You're done! By default, sessions auto timeout after 60 minutes of inactivity.
This value will be configurable in future versions of the plugin.
